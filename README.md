# Hello, I'm Gabriel

I’m a junior at the University of Nebraska Omaha pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science**, with a strong focus on **Cybersecurity**. I’m currently building hands-on experience through home lab projects and actively preparing to transition into the cybersecurity field.

## Objective
Motivated to pivot into cybersecurity and gain real-world experience in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment — starting in a **Tier 1 Analyst role** or other entry-level cybersecurity position where I can continue learning and contribute to protecting critical systems.
